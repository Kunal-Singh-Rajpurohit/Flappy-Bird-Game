# Flappy-Bird-Game
The aim of the project is to create a ‘Flappy Bird Game’ using basic knowledge of python. I am going to use the Virtual Studio Code IDE and the pygame module.Pygame is a library that is used in creating games in Python.Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. It helps us to create fully functional games and multimedia programs in python.

The core of Flappy Bird’s gameplay loop was that it was a ‘one more round’ type of game, where the barrier to entry was low and, once you started, there was no advantage to stopping, with the goal of the game to advance as far as possible and accumulate the highest score atleast up to ten.

The game will start when we will press either the spacebar or up key. It will exit if we press either the escape key or down key.
