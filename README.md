# Flappy-Bird-Game
The aim of the project is to create a ‘Flappy Bird Game’ using basic knowledge of python. I am going to use the Virtual Studio Code IDE and the pygame module.Pygame is a library that is used in creating games in Python.Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. It helps us to create fully functional games and multimedia programs in python.

The core of Flappy Bird’s gameplay loop was that it was a ‘one more round’ type of game, where the barrier to entry was low and, once you started, there was no advantage to stopping, with the goal of the game to advance as far as possible and accumulate the highest score atleast up to ten.

The game will start when we will press either the spacebar or up key. It will exit if we press either the escape key or down key.

The prerequisite of this project is the basic knowledge of python:

   ●	Game Loop =  While loop / Infinite loop in which we repeat the sprites(Images)  to display image on the screen i.e we will blit the image at 32 FPS.

   ●	Events = We will accept the event from the user.

   ●	Sprites = This are the Images we will be using.
               
   ●	 Sound = We will be different sounds for different events.

Open basis(images/sound) files in VS code or other editor.

Use pip install pygame in terminal bar to install pygame 

Installed the latest version of pygame

Read the pygame documentation.

Make the necessary imports

Go ahead and code.
